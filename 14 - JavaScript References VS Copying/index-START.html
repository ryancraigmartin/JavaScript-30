    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); // 100 100

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Lauren', 'Brandon', 'Ryan', 'Leo'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); // Returns the entire array

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]; // Takes every item out of the iterable and put it in the array
    team4[3] = 'aaaaaaaaaa';
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Ryan Martin',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 100;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 100, age: 24 });
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread which is the same as spreading into an array
    // const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const ryan = {
      name: 'Ryan',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@ryancraigmartin',
        facebook: 'nottellingyou!'
      }
    };

    console.clear();
    console.log(ryan);

    // Object.assign only goes one level deep. (Shallow)
    const dev = Object.assign({}, ryan);

    // Not a best practice. (Poor man's deep clone.)
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(ryan));
